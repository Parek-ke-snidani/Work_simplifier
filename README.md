Code I managed to write at my job to simplify my tasks. :-)
## Download_IMG_Napojse

I got products with EAN codes in excel file and I had to download images which supplier shared through Napojse.cz
### Little overview
Open browser (Firefox) -> search website (napojse.cz) -> sign in with email and password -> copy ean from excel -> search ean on the website -> download image (if image not found write it to excel) and name it after name of the product on website-> repeat and save excel every 10th loop
